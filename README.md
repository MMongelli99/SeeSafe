# SeeSafe
The system takes visual data and determines if it is safe to move forward by determining if there are obstacles in front of the user. This would make it easier for the visually impaired to navigate, using their phone for instance, instead of needing other aid devices like a seeing eye dog or a cane to navigate unfamiliar spaces.
